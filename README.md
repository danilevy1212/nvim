# Dan's Neovim configuration

Come and see, how an emacs user tries out neovim.

## Structure

I try to stick to the structure set by [neovim's runtime path](https://thevaluable.dev/vim-runtime-guide-example/#:~:text=If%20you're%20a%20Neovim,startup%2C%20sometimes%20in%20different%20ways.) where I can. Other important folders are:

- [Settings](./lua/config)

  Neovim's builtin settings configuration

- [Modules](./lua/modules)

  External plugins configurations.
